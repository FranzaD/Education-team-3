Explanation:


# Checking final lmer model assumptions

## Linearity
Good case is if there is a random pattern in the scatter of the data, since there is a patter this suggests we need to transform the predictor or a response.

Log, square, and exp on the response to not yeild a random scatter plot. 

__Conclusion is this assumption is violated.__
```{r}
#checking Linearity
model_linearity <- plot(resid(model),media_pls1$plspr)
```

### log transform on response still shows a pattern
```{r}
plot(resid(model),log(media_pls1$plspr))
```

### square transform on response still shows a pattern
```{r}
plot(resid(model),(media_pls1$plspr)^2)
```
```{r}
#checking Linearity
model_linearity <- plot(resid(model),(media_pls1$plspr)/2)
```


## Homogeneity of Variance
Regression assumes variance of residuals is equal for every individual

In the residual vs fitted graph we would expect to find an even spread around the center line.

__Conclusion is this assumption is Violated.__
```{r}
plot(model)
```

#### Levene's Test (manual)for homogeneity of variance 
Computationally we'd like to see if this assumption holds, we can use Levene's Test for this.

Since the p-value is less than 0.05 we can conclude that there is enough evidence to conclude that we can reject the null hypothesis that states that the residual variances are equal. Hence we conclude that at least one residual variance is not equalt to the others.
__Conclusion is this assumption is violated.__
```{r}
media_pls1$model_residuals<- residuals(model) #extracts the residuals and places them in a new column in our original data table
media_pls1$abs_model_residuals <- abs(media_pls1$model_residuals) #creates a new column with the absolute value of the residuals
media_pls1$model_residuals_squared <- media_pls1$abs_model_residuals ^2 #squares the absolute values of the residuals to provide the more robust estimate
levene_model <- lm(model_residuals_squared ~ child_id, data=media_pls1) #ANOVA of the squared residuals
anova(levene_model) #displays the results
```
### Levene's Test (Automatic) for Homogeneity of Variance
potentially get back to this
```{r}
# Levene's test with multiple independent variables
#leveneTest(len ~ supp*dose, data = media_pls1)
```

### Bartlett's for homogeneity of variance
https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/homogeneity-of-variance-test-in-r/
```{r}
#maybe for later


```
## Residuals of Model are Normally Distributed
QQplots provide a estimation of where the standardized residuals lie with respect to the normal quantiles, strong deviation from the line indicates the residuals are not normally distributed.

__Conclusion is this assumption is met.__
```{r}
qqmath(model)
```

"When data are positively correlated within individual, ignoring the correlation in the analysis (e.g., fitting
an ordinary least squares linear regression) will lead to inflated type I error rates for time-independent
variables (e.g., sex, race) because of underestimated standard errors and inflated type II error rates for
time-dependent variables (e.g., the time effect, certain biologic measurements and weight)..
4"
 
* Modeling of different types of within-person correlation structures
* correlation of repeated measures on the same individual can be accounted for by including random effects 𝜸 and by specifying a structure for G.
* the commonly used ‘exchangeable’ (or compound
symmetry) correlation structure, in which the same correlation is assumed for all pairs of measurements
on the same person irrespective of their timing, can be modeled either by (1) including a random
intercept for each person
